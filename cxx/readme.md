Notes:

Please forgive me for writing template

Could use some work making it less verbose

Tree_ argument

can go through and add `[[nodiscard]]`

std::algorithm sometimes makes things feel a little unKISS

gcc says: Blossom.hpp:40:48: internal compiler error: trying to capture ‘this’ in instantiation of generic lambda


mixins, don't delete polymorphically
